“Would you offer your kids 12 teaspoons of sugar and several espressos?” That’s the issue Jamie Oliver just lately asked in a good tweet, within his campaign to modify the sales of energy beverages in the UK.

Within New Zealand, a high heart surgeon is calling for a similar thing. Cardiologist Harvey Light says energy beverages are more harmful than most of the people realise, and was recently reported in the mass media calling for their sale to be limited to persons over 16. Other wellbeing experts agree with the fact; Otago University professor Jim Mann and AUT professor Elaine Hurry also support regulation.

Professor Mann says the drinks are no good for children or individuals. “They seriously serve no useful purpose for anyone”, he informed Radio Live. He remarked that some energy beverages have significantly more sugar than standard sugary fizzy drinks, and also containing caffeine.

It’s very difficult to disagree with the decision to get these beverages out of your hands of children, at the minimum. Energy drinks can cause health problems - and not just for kids. Dr White reports people regularly showing up at hospital with racing hearts and chest pain consequently of drinking energy beverages, especially when combined with alcohol. New Canadian research found a lot more than 55 % of energy drink users experienced health problems, including nausea, fast heartbeat, insomnia, vomiting and head aches. There were also instances of seizures.

If any other food caused these issues, there’d be an outcry. We’d have restrictions on it, just as we carry out with alcohol and cigarettes. 

It’s distressing that teens, in particular, are actually drawn to energy drinks. They’re arguably among the age ranges who really don’t want extra energy, in the sense of a pick-me-up, staying packed with youthful vitality currently. I can’t start to see the appeal of the taste, either.

So energy beverages have, then, been a good triumph of advertising. They have a neat photo; the branding is made to appeal to teens, particularly teen boys. They have cool, rebellious-sounding brands such as Monster and Demon. They’re in black cans with masculine design. NOS ‘liquid energy’ branding is definitely vaguely drug-like. The web site duplicate says: “NOS is similar to taking your previous mans [sic] Audi, decreasing it on a mean set of 22’s, ripping off the exhaust and jacking it up with a mean as Nitrous Oxide Program… make a freakin jet Nitrous Oxide Program!” A good 500ml serve of the High Octane variety has 56 grams of sugar (that’s over 11 teaspoons) and 130mg caffeine, which is approximately the same as a go of espresso. Demon Hell Fire strength drink is similar, comprising 12 teaspoons of sugar and 160mg caffeine. It’s simple to see how that is, as advertised, ‘not for the faint-hearted’.

In the future, I am certain we’ll look back upon this instant and marvel at how drinks like this could have been sold freely to kids. Let’s certainly not leave it too long until that evening arrives.
