## Keep these in mind

According to Australian scientists Denise Hardesty and Chris Wilcox estimate, who using trash collected on U.S. coastlines for over five years, in America, there are nearly 7.5 million plastic straws around the coastline. And Milo Cress, the initiator of Be Straws Free Campaign, claimed that the consumption of plastic straws in America is up to 500 million a day, most of which end up in the ocean. To avoid the abuse of plastic straws, in July 2018, Seattle has carried out a decree to ban food suppliers from providing single-use plastic straws. Soon after, Starbucks promised to eliminate them by 2020. Along with people’s awareness of environment protection, the eco-friendly alternatives for plastic straws is irresistible nowadays.
We tested 4 major types of straws on both cold and hot drinks to list their pros and cons below.

#### Compostable straws
Compostable straw is essentially a one-time straw in more environment-friendly material. Thus, there’s no need to worry about carrying them after use or bother cleaning them. However, an obstacle with compostable straws is the longer they stay in the liquid, the soggier they become. For cold drink, they typically stay sound for an hour or two. But once you put them into hot drink, they will fall apart within 10 minutes.

#### Stainless-steel straws
Stainless-steel straws are good in terms of use, durability and ease of cleaning. They are the only reusable straws that could smash through the plastic cover easily. One drawback of metal straws is that they tend to absorb the temperature of the liquid, getting chilly in the cold drinks and warm in the hot drinks. There is also concern that acidic drinks such as lemon juice may cause corrosion of the inner side of the straw.

#### Bamboo straws
The bamboo straws have a sturdiness that the compostable and the silicone ones do not, but they still lacked the heft to break through a plastic cover. In addition, the bamboo straws were a little too small for boba-alike stuff to pass. Sticky residue in bubble tea or smoothies are likely got caught within the tube, therefore cleaning bamboo straws could be frustrating.
